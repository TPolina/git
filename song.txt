Empty spaces -
what are we living for
Abandoned places -
I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for

Another hero 
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
